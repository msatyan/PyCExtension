## PyCExtension
This is a sample Python package to demonstrate how to extent Python functionality by using C language routines. The Python provides flexibility, at the same time it is inherently slow. The C language extensions can act as a turbocharger for Python modules where it needs speed and efficiency.

#### [Wheels](https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
 The wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and the .whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP 376 compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk format

```python
pip install wheel 
pip install twine 
pip install tox
